PV module has diode and many other things that can affect life cycles
Temperature can affect greatly to the RUL

## Excel file structure

overlapping 4 modules -> Tiep theo -> bp1 - bp4 -> TT(TT1) -> Algorithm
overlapping 3 modules -> Tiep theo -> bp5 - bp10 -> TT(TT1) -> Algorithm
overlapping 2 modules -> Tiep theo -> bp11 - bp19 -> TT(TT1) -> Algorithm
one bypass per module -> Tiep theo -> P54 - P63-> TT(TT1) -> Algorithm

only need three variables: temp Nf LC

## TODO

- Create the LC dataset with the above rules
- Predict LC with the new dataset
- Read SSO paper
- SSO code

## Suggestions
